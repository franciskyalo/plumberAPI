## The primary focus of this project is to show how the plumber package in R is used to create RESTful API's that can be used to make predictions in real time 
RESTful API is a way for two computer systems to communicate and share information securely over the internet. Many business applications need to communicate with other internal and external systems in order to perform different tasks. For example, to create monthly pay stubs, an internal accounts system would need to share data with a customer's banking system to automate billing and communicate with an internal time tracking application. RESTful APIs facilitate this information exchange by following secure, dependable, and efficient communication standards. 

The Swagger UI makes it possible for anyone, such as a development team or end users, to view and interact with the API's resources without having to know the underlying implementation details. It is generated automatically from the OpenAPI specification, providing an easy to understand visual documentation for both the back-end implementation and front-end consumption.

The plumber package in R allows you to create a RESTful API from your R code. It allows you to expose R code as a web service, making it easy for other systems to access the functionality provided by your R code. It can therefore be used to expose model predictions as endpoints that can be interacted with.
